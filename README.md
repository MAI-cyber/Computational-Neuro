Neuron Models

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Computational Neuroscience course! This repository contains Python code implementations of various neural models and algorithms used in computational neuroscience. The code examples provided here include simulations and analyses related to Hodgkin and Huxley model, Leaky integrate and fire model, Balanced neural network, and Recurrent neural network.

Introduction:

Computational neuroscience explores the principles and mechanisms underlying neural systems through mathematical and computational models. This repository serves as a resource for the Computational Neuroscience course, providing code implementations of key neural models and algorithms.

Hodgkin and Huxley Model:

The Hodgkin and Huxley model is a mathematical model that describes the generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. The code in this repository demonstrates simulations and analysis of the Hodgkin and Huxley model, allowing you to explore the behavior of action potentials and ion channel dynamics.

Leaky Integrate and Fire Model:

The Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) model is a simplified neuron model that captures the basic behavior of neural membrane potential. The code provided here enables you to simulate LIF neurons and investigate their firing patterns under different stimuli and parameter settings.

Balanced Neural Network:

The Balanced Neural Network model is used to study the dynamics of large-scale neural circuits. It aims to capture the balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain. The code in this repository allows you to simulate and analyze balanced neural networks, providing insights into their collective dynamics and stability properties.

Recurrent Neural Network:

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks with feedback connections. RNNs are particularly useful for modeling time-dependent or sequential data. The code examples provided here demonstrate the implementation and training of RNNs using Python, enabling you to explore their capabilities in capturing temporal dependencies.
